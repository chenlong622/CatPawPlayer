## Key Features

* **Native WinUI 3 & Fluent Design System**:
  * Built with Windows App SDK 1.6 and native Mica / Acrylic materials, supporting seamless real-time switching between Light, Dark, and System theme modes.
  * **Brand New App Icon & 4 Customizable Styles**: Features an all-new official default "Classic Blue" icon crafted with continuous superellipse curvature ($n=4.8$) and transparent alpha channels. Choose between **Classic Blue**, **Aurora Pink**, **Obsidian Dark**, and **Neon Cyber** in Settings with instant live switching across Windows Taskbar and Title Bar.
* **Native Media Server Aggregation (Emby / Jellyfin / Plex)**:
  * **Seamless Private & Public Integration**: Connect your self-hosted Emby, Jellyfin, and Plex media servers directly. Browse libraries, seasons/episodes, resume watching lists, and latest releases in a single unified interface.
  * **Ultra-Fast Millisecond Concurrency Search**: Performs asynchronous parallel searches across self-hosted media servers and online crawler sources simultaneously. Private server results load in ~100ms with prioritized display.
  * **Lossless Direct Streaming & Bidirectional Progress Sync**: Direct stream passthrough to the Yaozhi-MPV hardware acceleration engine, preserving 4K HDR, Dolby Vision, multi-audio tracks, and embedded/external subtitles. Watch progress and resume points are synced with your server in real-time.
  * **Multi-Source Icon Subscriptions & Custom Skinning**: Bundles polished official brand icons and supports importing Quantumult X / Loon icon subscriptions. Features keyword icon search and visual icon selection for effortless server customization.
* **Universal Multi-Engine Spider Architecture**:

  * **Built-in Portable Yaozhi-MPV Engine**: Comes with a self-contained built-in [Yaozhil/mpv-Yaozhi](https://github.com/Yaozhil/mpv-Yaozhi) hardware acceleration environment (`runtime/mpv/mpv.exe`) for out-of-the-box 4K UHD, HEVC/H.265, Dolby Vision, and 60/120FPS ultra-high framerate decoding without requiring any external player setup.
  * **Customizable External Yaozhi-MPV Engine**: Also based on [Yaozhil/mpv-Yaozhi](https://github.com/Yaozhil/mpv-Yaozhi), specify your own external `mpv.exe` path to leverage your personal `mpv.conf`, custom Shaders (Anime4K, FSRCNNX), custom keybindings, and Lua script extensions. Globally managed under Settings.
* **Integrated Cloud Drive Authorization Console**:
  * Scan-to-login QR code console embedded directly within the application for Quark, UC, Alibaba Cloud, Baidu Netdisk, and 115, enabling automated cloud transfer and 4K streaming.
* **Kernel-Level Real-Time Playback Telemetry**:
  * Real-time extraction of actual decoded resolution (e.g., 1080P FHD, 4K UHD), pixel dimensions (`1920×1080`, `3840×2160`), video/audio codecs, and live stream bitrates.
* **Lightweight IPTV Live TV Streaming & EPG Engine**:
  * Integrated "Live" TV section directly accessible from the centered top navigation capsule.
  * Import custom remote M3U / TXT playlist URLs or select local `.m3u` / `.txt` files with zero bundled third-party streams for complete legal and privacy safety.
  * Automatic intelligent channel categorization (CCTV, Satellite, Regional, HD), automatic channel logo matching, and real-time EPG program guide schedule display.
  * Instant switching between embedded WebView2 playback and independent external MPV window hardware acceleration with auto-reconnect fallback.
* **Immersive Full-Bleed Top Bar & Frosted Glass Capsules**:
  * Edge-to-edge poster hero headers extending to the window top boundary for an expansive visual canvas.
  * High-transparency frosted glass (Acrylic / Mica) floating capsule navigation buttons with smooth hover transitions.
* **Cross-Source Aggregate Search & Filter**:
  * Asynchronous concurrent multi-site searching and multi-level category filtering to discover high-quality media across all active subscription sites.

2. Click **"Add Media Server"** and choose your server type (Emby / Jellyfin / Plex).
3. Enter your server URL (LAN IP like `http://192.168.1.100:8096` or public domain), port, and credentials:
   - **Emby / Jellyfin**: Authenticate using username and password, or directly provide an API Key.
   - **Plex**: Enter server address and your `X-Plex-Token`.
4. Click **"Test Connection"** to verify, then save. Media libraries and watching progress will sync automatically.

### 2. Icon Subscriptions & Custom Skinning

## Playback Engine & Customization

AinanPlayer hardware acceleration is fully powered by **[Yaozhil/mpv-Yaozhi](https://github.com/Yaozhil/mpv-Yaozhi)**, supporting both **Built-in Out-of-the-Box** and **Customizable External** playback modes:

1. **Default Built-in Playback**: Ready to play immediately upon extracting or installing. Uses the bundled high-performance [Yaozhil/mpv-Yaozhi](https://github.com/Yaozhil/mpv-Yaozhi) hardware acceleration engine (`runtime/mpv/mpv.exe`) with zero third-party dependencies required.
2. **Customizable External Yaozhi-MPV**:
   * Navigate to **"Settings" -> "Playback Engine Settings"**.
   * Toggle on **"Enable External MPV Hardware Acceleration"**.
   * Click **"Browse..."** to select your own [Yaozhil/mpv-Yaozhi](https://github.com/Yaozhil/mpv-Yaozhi) `mpv.exe` path (e.g. `D:\Yaozhi-MPV\mpv.exe`).
   * Click **"Test Launch MPV"** to verify. Playback will then automatically load your external shaders, scripts, and keybindings.
3. **Customizable Application Icons**:
   * Select between **Classic Blue**, **Aurora Pink**, **Obsidian Dark**, or **Neon Cyber** under "Settings" -> "Appearance" to instantly switch the Taskbar and Title Bar icons.
